## BioAuth

*Behavioral Biometric Authentication plugin for Moodle*

## Purpose
The BioAuth Moodle Plugin utilizes behavioral biometrics recorded during quiz attempts in order to verify the identity of online test takers. Instructors are able to confirm or dismiss suspicions of cheating students and respond appropriately. The workflow of existing courses will not be affected, allowing a seamless integration for institutions who wish to adopt this technology and ensure academic integrity.
