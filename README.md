## BioAuth

*Behavioral Biometric Authentication plugin for Moodle*

[BioAuth v1.0](https://bitbucket.org/vmonaco/moodle-local_bioauth/downloads/bioauth_1.0.tar.gz) can be downloaded and installed. **This version is a work in progress and has undergone significant changes since the first release.**

## Purpose
The BioAuth Moodle Plugin records keyboard and mouse activity site-wide on Moodle. On every page which contains site navigation elements, a script is loaded on the client that periodically sends keystroke and mouse events back to the server. The data can then be downloaded and used for behavioral biometric authentication or identification.
